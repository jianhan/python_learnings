"""Python has special syntax for the stride of a slice in

"""The problem is that the stride syntax often causes unexpected behav-
ior that can introduce bugs. For example, a common Python trick for
reversing a byte string is to slice the string with a stride of -1"""

"""I suggest you avoid using a stride along with
start and end indexes. If you must use a stride, prefer making it a
positive value and omit start and end indexes. If you must use a stride
with start or end indexes, consider using one assignment for striding
